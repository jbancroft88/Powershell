# A script to automatically identify running processes which have logged errors with the WMI Provider Host Service
# This reveals which client process(es) execution are potentially resulting in excessive CPU/Memory activity on the WmiPrvSE.exe process

# This is common issue on Windows systems, and is acknowledged and documented by Microsoft under the following article:
# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/system-management-components/high-cpu-usage-wmiprvse-process-regular-intervals
# The article states that the workaround is to "Identify the process using a large number of handles or a large amount of memory" and terminate it.
# However, the OS does not provide us with a method to quickly identify the number of potential candidates.
# As a result, troubleshooting this problem can be very time consuming when checking log files and system infomation manually.
